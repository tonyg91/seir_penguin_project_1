###Day One Issues 
I came across an issue on some of the questions that when clicking the right answer it was returning incorrect in the console.log test. Upon investigating the issue I noticed that when making my questions I had a space after the answer which was causing it to return incorrect. After deleting the spaces and publishing the changes it resolved the issue. 

###Day Two Issues 
When adjusting the game to be more mobile I came across an issue with the answers text flowing outside of there boxs. I adjusted the size of the font as well as change the height settings to auto so that the text will fit in any screen size.


#### I have trouble with 

My code looked like this

```js
console.log("hello")
```

It was a giving me a problem... when it was fixed it looked like this:

```js
console.log("goodbye")
````
